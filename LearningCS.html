            <p>Python was the first real coding language I took a class on, starting in I believe 7th grade at Mountainridge doing projects in Ozaria. I also continued in python this year in Ms. Storie's Computer Science class, which is where my past projects came from.</p>

            <p>I also had some experience in my 7th grade computer science class with HTMl and CSS, but quite minimal compared to what we have learned thanks to Ms Lynn! I personally like Python more than HTML and CSS but being able to build up websites is fun and will definitely be useful for some future classes or projects.</p>

            <p>JavaScript has been quite a mystery to me, but being able to learn some has been fun and interesting. While it is my least favorite coding language, it is still very interesting to learn and explore. I appreciate how versatile it is, allowing for dynamic web applications and interactive features. Even though there are moments of frustration, solving problems and seeing things come to life on the screen makes it all worthwhile.</p>
